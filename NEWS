Version 1.0-7 (2011-12-21)
  + Add equi join of bi.EG_GENE_INFO to gtiChipAnnotation, in order to get GeneNames annotated

Version 1.0-6 (2011-12-20)
  + Following suggestions of Laura, the race prefix is changed into gti
  + Thanks for Stan's feedback: ORACLE_BASE and ORACLE_HOME environment variables are set in the .onLoad function
  + ORACLE_BASE is set when there is no environment variable, or the path pointed to by the variable does not contain the "client" subfolder.
  + ORACLE_HOME is set when there is no environment variable, or the path pointed to by the variable does not contain the "bin" subfolder.
  + To test the ribiosAnnotation in a free environment, use "exec env -i bash --norc".

Version 1.0-4 (2011-12-16)
  + Current functions have been renamed to better reflect their functions
  + raceChiptypes (aka raceChipnames) returns a list of supported chip types (in the form of character vector)
  + raceChipAnnotation provides all annotation information for a certain chip
  + annotateProbesets provides annotation information for queried probesets.
  + The version numbering system is now consistent with the R convention (x.y-z)

Version 1.0.3 (2011-12-15)
  + Only BIOS-specific functions have been kept in the new ribiosAnnotation package, other functions relying on Bioc annotation mechanisms have been moved to the ciocAnnotation package, which shall not be part of the ribios suite). 
  + Functions are renamed in a consistent way, representing their functionality. The old names are deprecated.
