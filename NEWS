Version 1.0-19 (2012-10-03)
  + Add matchv, imatch, imatchv, ipmatch, ipmatchv for case-insentative matches

Version 1.0-18 (2012-10-02)
  + Add munion, mintersect and msetdiff for _m_ultiple-set operations.
  + Add midentical to test whether all objects are identical

Version 1.0-16 (2012-06-22)
  + Add mmatch function: It performs efficient multiple matching between vectors using BIOS-C codes. Thanks to Roland Schmucki for sharing C codes.
  + Documentation and test files were added for mmatch
  + matchColumnIndex (and consequently matchColumn) uses mmatch for multiple matching, improving speed drastically
  + Add assertFile, assertDir, isDir, checkDir, checkFile, ... functions for scripting
  + Add various 'small' functions from on-going projects
  + Implement half of missing documentations

Version 1.0-15 (2012-06-20)
  + matchColumnIndex is not a little more efficient in doing the multiple matching. However it requires substantion re-coding in C to make it as efficient as normal match. The work is ongoing.

Version 1.0-14 (2012-06-06)
  + Add functions for scripting uses: setDebug, unsetDebug, isDebugging and isIntDebugging

Version 1.0-13 (2012-05-07)
  + srv/Makevars now use bioenv defined variable names, instead of hard-coding dependencies
  + Minor change in the pwdecode documentation
  + The version has been installed on biostat server

Version 1.0-12 (2012-03-22)
  + Add pwdecode function (with C backend) to decode passwords encypted with pwencode command-line tool
  + (Internal) pwdecode has a parsimonious Makevar file. And it successfully avoids the die mechanism of BIOS system by providing a imposter macro.

Version 1.0-11 (2012-03-09)
  + Add matrix2longdf function to convert a matrix into long format data.frame
  + Add extname function to get extension of file names
  + Add openFileDevice function to open a display device as a file, preparing to print plots to the file.

Version 1.0-10 (2012-02-10)
  + Both matchColumnIndex and matchColumn function supports both column index and column names, and the matching of row names.
  + Both matchColumnIndex and matchColumn supports the multi parameter, specifying the behaviour of function in multiple-matching cases.
  + matchColumnIndex over-writes the column with the master vector: also in the case of multiple mapping.
  + Documentations have been added for matchColumn and matchColumnIndex.

Version 1.0-9 (2012-02-06)
  + Add verbose function to allow verbose-level specific printing of verbose information, especially useful in programs with user interfaces.

Version 1.0-8 (2012-01-18)
  + The library function is checked for the support of "quietly" option in libordie by checking the base package version (>=2.13.0 supports quietly=TRUE)

Version 1.0-7 (2011-12-21)
  + Add isError function for try-error catch blocks
  + qqmsg tests whether message is empty, if no no message will be print, in order to prevent a blank line to be printed

Version 1.0-6 (2011-12-19)
  + Remove the dependency on the gsl library, which causes problem when the path is not known.

Version 1.0-5 (2011-12-19)
  + Add summarizeRows and summarizeColumns to summarize rows/columns by factor
  + Add the documentation for the dfFactor function.

Version 1.0.4 (2011-12-16)
  + Add qqmsg (function and documentation) to quitely quit a R session.  
  + add libordie function to silently load a library when possible or kill the R session otherwise

Version 1.0.3 (2011-12-15)
  + Add the methods package into depend list

Version 1.0.2 (skipped since no stable release was made)

Version 1.0.1 (2011-11-28)
  + Add data.frame and matrix manipulation methods
  + Updated the fme_cor function, although it is not finished.
