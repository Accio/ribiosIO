Version 1.0-3 (Oct 02, 2012)
  + gseaFingerprint is now able to deal with cases where the phenotypes are now named in default as 'pos' and 'neg'. Since in such cases, the order of positive/negative is not clearly defined, we use the alphabetic order of phenotype names as 'pos' and 'neg'.

Version 1.0-2 (Jul 16, 2012)
  + gseaFingerprintMatrix: omit empty directories
  + gseaFingerprintMatrix: stops if all input directories are detected NOT to be GSEA result folders
  + gseaQvalue: q-values is given in -log10(p) instead of -log(p) (base-10) to make interpretation easier
  + Add buildGSEAcomm: build bash commands to run GSEA. Able to deal with irregular file names

Version 1.0-1 (Jun 07, 2012)
  + gseaFingerprints.Rscript: remove empty lines from input file

Version 1.0-0 (Jun 06, 2012)
  + Establish the ribiosGSEA package
  + Refactor GSEA-related functions from other packages
  + Add functions used to extract fingerprints from GSEA results
