  + argParse: now optargs and reqargs can be set to NULL without causing the R session to crash
  + The log.h module of bios has been replaced by the local mimics, in order not to crash the R session in case problems. Note that however arg_init() and arg_try() still must be called before argGet() and argPresent(). Otherwise the program will end reporting the segfault "memory not mapped".

2013-01-23: v1.1-1
  + Add scriptInit to prepare R for the script

2013-01-04: v1.1-0
  + Add BIOS-style command-line parser: argParser, argGet, argGetPos and argPresent. 

2012-01-24: v1.0-5
  + Add RscriptName function to get the file name of the current Rscript

2011-12-19: v1.0-4
  + The parseNumVec parameter accepts NULL as expLen value, in order to parse variable-length number vectors

2011-12-15: v1.0.3
  + The onlyArg and/or missingArg parameter of the getArg function can be set to NULL now (in previous versions this would cause an error)
  + Add tests folder to keep consistent behaviours of important functions (now getArg is under control, parseNumVec and existArg shall be tested similarly in future releases)

2011-10-10: v1.0.2
  + (Important) getArg differentiates options (starting with a minus sign AND a non-numeric character, namely 0-9 or the dot) and negative numbers (starting with a minus sign, followed by numeric characters). For instance, "-a" is an option, but the "-3,4" in "-a -3,4" will be treated as value for "a". Arguments, which contain at least one character which is not number or punctuation characters (see ?regex), will be considered as an option (parameter) instead of a value, for instance "-3way".
  + parseNumVec removes leading and training quotes when existing.


2011-10-04: v1.0.1
  + parseNumVec suppresses warnings during the attempts to convert strings to numbers
