Version 1.0.4 (2011-12-07)
  + Add the read_gmt_list function to read in gmt files
  + Bug fix: ls_destroy() has been added to read_gmt C function (this bug had no visible effect on users, but with potential memory issues)

Version 1.0.3 (2011-11-18)
  + Add a correct version of iofile (the older version in ribios has a bug when the input paramter x has more than one values)

Version 1.0.2 (2011-11-17)
  + read_exprs_matrix function now supports the full table in case of space-delimited file.
  + read_exprs_matrix supports duplicated row names for tab or space delimited files
  + Wunschzettel: write a read_named_matrix routine to get around the read.table trick, which forces the data.frame structure and might be slow for large datasets

Version 1.0.1 (2011-11-16)
  + Add read_exprs_matrix for importing expression matrix from file (see help page)
  + C rountine read_gct checks the second line with arrayMax, and stops if it is not separated by tab
  + GCT file consistency check gives more useful information about feature numbers

Version 1.0 (2011-11-15)
  + Refactor read_gct from ribiosExpression
