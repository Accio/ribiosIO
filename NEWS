Version 1.1-1 (2011-12-16)
  + Update the DESCRIPTION file to better describe the content and goal of the ribiosBic package

Version 1.1.0 (2011-10-05)
  + Rename splitModuleByCor as splitISAModules, and drop the eset parameter since it is not used anymore

Version 1.0.2 (2011-07-11)
  + Add splitModuleByCor function in the package, to facilitate the use of ISAModules in signature settings.

Version 1.0.1 (2011-06-29)
  + getBinaryWeight function returns a numeric matrix, not an integer one, since the beta density C-routine implemented in the eisa package requires REAL pointer.

Version 1.0 (2011-05-18)
  + Functionalities related to ISA (Iterative Signature Algorithm) have been moved from the ribios package to this new package.
