Version 1.0-10 (Jan 04, 2012)
  + Bugfix in readEset: Previous versions report error when importing expression matrices with numeric values as column names. The burg is caused by the default behaviour of the 'read.table' function, which appends a prefix (by default X) to the column names and thus cause the readFKtable function to fail. This has been fixed now.
  + Add annotate and reannotate: to annotate ExpressionSet objects with information from GTI. Both are S4 methods with documentations and examples.
  + Add documentation for the ribios.ExpressionSet object.

Version 1.0-9 (Jan 03, 2012)
  + Add the function kendallW and a S4-method kendallWmat. One of their usages is to detect sub-groups of probesets showing strong expression correlation. 

Version 1.0-8 (Dec 20, 2011)
  + PCA-related data structures and functions are re-factored into the ribiosPCA package.

Version 1.0-7 (Dec 19, 2011)
  + add summarizeProbesets to summarize probesets
  + NAMESPACE are now explicitly stated
  + apply2 and summarizeRows have been removed since they are now part of the ribiosUtils package.

Version 1.0-6 (Dec 16, 2011)
  + Add dependency on the ribiosAnnotation package
  + Add writeEset and readEset functions for importing/exporting ExpressionSet objects.
  + annotatedByChipname has been removed. Its functionality is replaced by the annotateProbesets in the ribiosAnnotation package.
  + readFKdata was renamed as readFKtable, which is now fully documented and ready to be exported
  + readFKdata supports two basic modes: strict.order=TRUE (as before) and strict.order=FALSE (can be of any order of FK, so far all FKs are covered)
  + annotateByChipname is completely replaced by annotateProbesets

Version 1.0.5 (Dec 15, 2011)
  + Mark annotateByChipname as priority to be updated: the current version has been made a copy in the biocAnnotation package (outside of the ribios suite). A replacement in the ribios suite will be placed in the ribiosAnnotation
  + (Upstreaming updates) ribiosUtils depends on methods and therefore the rowscale can be imported from
  + Add git version control

Version 1.0.4 (Nov 25, 2011)
  + Move data.frame and matrix functions to the ribiosUtils package
  + Depend on the ribiosUtils package

Version 1.0.3 (Nov 15, 2011)
  + Refactor read_gct into ribiosIO for efficiency (since no class information like ExpressionSet is needed there)

Version 1.0.2 (Nov 14, 2011)
  + Change keepHighestVarProbe to more generalized keepMaxStatProbe

Version 1.0.1 (Nov 11, 2011)
  + Remove the path option sfrom the readGctCls function to make it consistent with readGct and readCls.
