Version 1.0.6 (2011-12-08)
  + This version is almost warning-free (except for -Wall) and is placed in the stable release as well.

Version 1.0.5 (2011-12-08)
  + Add the man page for read_gmt_list and iofile
  + Use assign/get instead of their symbolic shortcuts in the iofile function to prevent R-check warning against not-found global variables
  + Use "textStrtok" instead of "textFieldtok" since the former neglects empty fields automatically. The "P" (Preserve) variant was not necessary since the input char was not used anymore beyond the splitting.

Version 1.0.4 (2011-12-07)
  + Add the read_gmt_list function to read in gmt files
  + Bug fix: ls_destroy() has been added to read_gmt C function (this bug had no visible effect on users, but with potential memory issues)

Version 1.0.3 (2011-11-18)
  + Add a correct version of iofile (the older version in ribios has a bug when the input paramter x has more than one values)

Version 1.0.2 (2011-11-17)
  + read_exprs_matrix function now supports the full table in case of space-delimited file.
  + read_exprs_matrix supports duplicated row names for tab or space delimited files
  + Wunschzettel: write a read_named_matrix routine to get around the read.table trick, which forces the data.frame structure and might be slow for large datasets

Version 1.0.1 (2011-11-16)
  + Add read_exprs_matrix for importing expression matrix from file (see help page)
  + C rountine read_gct checks the second line with arrayMax, and stops if it is not separated by tab
  + GCT file consistency check gives more useful information about feature numbers

Version 1.0 (2011-11-15)
  + Refactor read_gct from ribiosExpression
