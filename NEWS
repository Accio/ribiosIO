Version 1.0-16 (2012-02-13)
  + the ORA object assignment is done after exporting ORACLE.BASE and ORACLE.LIB, to adapt to the newest version (1.1-1) of ROracle package
  + the gtiChipAnnotation function does not break when no probeset was annotated (due to logical(0) before)

Version 1.0-15 (2012-02-10)
  + gtiChiptypes uses genome.CHIP_ARRAY_TYPES@bin table to report GTI-supported chip types. Comparing previous versions, the default behavior is not changing. By settign 'include.desc=TRUE', more details are returned, includeing Technology and Species.
  + gtiChipAnnotation uses genome.chip_probeset_gene and genome.GTI_GENES internally, in order to be 100% synchronized with GTI. The resulting data.frame keeps consistency, although the isSingleGeneID column is always set to TRUE since only uniquely mapped probesets are stored. Provisionally this column shall be removed in the future version.
  + We export the hapmapSnp and illuminaSnp functions thanks to Isabelle's help. They are able to query SNP annotation and genomic contexts with user input.

Version 1.0-14 (2012-02-07)
  + Add isGtiChiptype to check user input with GTI-supported chiptypes	
  + Change the default order of 'db' in the querydb function to c("bia", "bin")
  + gtiChipAnnotation has been substantially refactored: that for queries <1000 items, the filtering is done by the IN syntax of SQL instead by R. Doing so saves much overhead of transfering large tables between SQL and R. A benchmark with random sampled GeneIDs (see codes in the test directory) showed a 5-10x better performance measured by the running time.
  + gtiChipAnnotation documentation has been correspondingly updated	
  + ORACLE.IN.NMAX constant variable is exported: the maximum length of the vector in the IN query syntax
  + Add mappedProbesets to get all probesets that map to given Entrez GeneIDs.
  + We have solved the mysterious issue of example codes in the ribiosAnnotation package:by wrapping example codes with options(error=utils:recover) and options(error=NULL), the examples can be executed now in the check process without issuing error. Although we do not really know why this is the case, this information should be shared with all developers who have had similar problems. 

Version 1.0-13 (2012-02-03)
  + Add querydb to make generic db queries
  + Add chrLen to query chromosome lengths in supported organisms

Version 1.0-12 (2012-02-02)
  + gtiTaxAnnotation returns MappedChr, CoordLeft, CoordRight and RevComp for chromosome-mapping information, by outer joining the genome.gti_gene_map_a@genome table
  + Internal: connection to the bia server ia authenticated by bi.
  + gtiChipAnnotation (and downstream annotateProbesets) uses 'bi.EG_GENE_INFO.OFFICIAL_SYMBOL' for GeneSymbol instead of 'bi.AFFYCHIP_XREF_LL.GN'

Version 1.0-11 (2012-02-01)
  + Add gtiTaxAnnotation.Rd to get annotations belonging to the given TaxonID.
  + Change newcon to newconBIA, add newconBIN to prepare for connection to the BIN server

Version 1.0-10 (2012-01-25)
  + annotateIDs sets the queried IDs in its column, which affects annotateProbesets, annotateGeneIDs and annotateGeneSymbols

Version 1.0-9 (2012-01-24)
  + Add annotateGeneIDs and annotateGeneSymbols to annotate GeneIDs/GeneSymbols in a similar fashion as that for probesets
  + annotateProbeIDs have been added as a synonym to annotateProbesets
  + Internally the core logic of annotateProbesets is refactored into \code{annotateIDs} to be shared by \code{annotateGeneIDs} and \code{annotateGeneSymbols}.
  + Add a Rscript to do annotation from command line: inst/Rscript/ribios_annotate.R
  + Add test bash file and test text files for ribios_annotate.Rscript

Version 1.0-8 (2012-01-06)
  + bioc2gti and gti2bioc support missing argument. If 'chipname' is left missing, the functions will print GTI/Bioc names of chip types supported by both GTI and Bioc.

Version 1.0-7 (2011-12-21)
  + Add join of bi.EG_GENE_INFO to gtiChipAnnotation, in order to get GeneNames

Version 1.0-6 (2011-12-20)
  + Following suggestions of Laura, the race prefix is changed into gti
  + Thanks for Stan's feedback: ORACLE_BASE and ORACLE_HOME environment variables are set in the .onLoad function
  + ORACLE_BASE is set when there is no environment variable, or the path pointed to by the variable does not contain the "client" subfolder.
  + ORACLE_HOME is set when there is no environment variable, or the path pointed to by the variable does not contain the "bin" subfolder.
  + To test the ribiosAnnotation in a free environment, use "exec env -i bash --norc".

Version 1.0-4 (2011-12-16)
  + Current functions have been renamed to better reflect their functions
  + raceChiptypes (aka raceChipnames) returns a list of supported chip types (in the form of character vector)
  + raceChipAnnotation provides all annotation information for a certain chip
  + annotateProbesets provides annotation information for queried probesets.
  + The version numbering system is now consistent with the R convention (x.y-z)

Version 1.0.3 (2011-12-15)
  + Only BIOS-specific functions have been kept in the new ribiosAnnotation package, other functions relying on Bioc annotation mechanisms have been moved to the ciocAnnotation package, which shall not be part of the ribios suite). 
  + Functions are renamed in a consistent way, representing their functionality. The old names are deprecated.

Version 1.0.2 (skipped since no stable release was made)
