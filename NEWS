  + Add whiteblack and blackwhite to two-color palettes

2011-11-22 v1.0.8
  + Add guessWH function to automatically guess the width/heigh ratio of heatmaps
  + Margins are automatically determined smartly, dependent on the xlab/ylab 

2011-11-17 v1.0.7
  + biosHeatmap.Rscript: the options lwids and lheis are obsolete, since they are now exclusively determined by the input data, namely matrix dim and row/col name character lengths, with considering the minimum size of legend
  + Wunschzettel: Check so-called all-NA lines and warns user; clustering algorithm should be made robust to all NAs.

2011-11-16 v1.0.6
  + biosHeatmap.Rscript: the data import function has been taken over by ribiosIO::read_exprs_matrix
  + geneset_xyplot.Rscript: the data import function has been taken over by ribiosIO::read_exprs_matrix
  + biosHeatmap.Rscript: four parameters for layout, width, height, lwid and lhei, can now be guessed from the input data. To do: lwid and lhei are not needed any more and shall be deleted from both command line and web interface
  + biosHeatmap function: long titles (main) are wrapped into 40-character lines

2011-11-15 v1.0.5
  + add Rscript subdierectory in the inst directory, in order to hold plotting scripts
  + add geneset_xyplot.Rscript and test_geneset_xyplot.txt into the package
  + move biosHeatmap.Rscript into the package

2011-11-10 v1.0.4
  + export colorpanel function

2011-10-10 v1.0.3
  + add the zlim option to biosHeatmap, allowing defining color ranges by the user
  + Makefile now checks whether the user is in the bdedev mode, if so, it will install the package to the R-devel, otherwise it is installed to the normal R version.

2011-10-05 v1.0.2
  + add turyeb (turquoise, yellow and black)

2011-10-04 v1.0.1
  + margins are now automatically guessed
  + fine tunings of heatmap key plot parameters (mar and mgp)
  + refactors functions in the gplots package in ribiosPlot (by using GPL-2 license), to avoid heavy dependencies of gdata

2011-09-20 v1.0
  + ribiosPlot refactors visualization functions from the ribios package. These functions are still accessible by loading the ribios package by package dependency.
